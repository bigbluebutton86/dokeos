			<h1>Dokeos 2.0 Release - March 2011</h1>
Dokeos 2.0 brings the web 2.0 experience to your elearning and
collaboration platform with a true social platform and a lot of drag
and drop interactions. Dokeos 2.0 is a major release offering a
complete revolution as compared to Dokeos 1.8. We experienced that
teachers, trainers, students and trainees tend to use only a few
features in classical learning management systems. For two reasons: <ol>
				<li> Learning management systems remain complex and far
from the kind of software usability you find on a telephone, an Apple
or Ubuntu-based computer;</li>
				<li>The rich variety of pedagogical
scenarios (social networking, clinical case studies, serious games...)
is hampered by software complexity.</li>
			</ol> Dokeos solves these
two problems by offering a easy to use elearning platform that offers
scenarios and templates where needed. <br />
Dokeos 2.0 does not focus on adding new and trendy features nor does it
follows the hype of adding features that are only usefull to a limited
set of very highly skilled and experienced users and simply because
adding these features is possible. Instead we focus on the common user
and good and solid elearning solutions. We want to give the user
control over the content and allow her/him to create the elearning
training that (s)he has in mind with as little effort as needed and ans
quickly and easy as possible. <h3>Innovations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>AGENDA, Now visual and drag &amp; drop, like Google Agenda</li>
				<li>AUTHOR, Create courses online</li>
				<li>CATALOG, Displays a nice list of courses to register, with an access to the course description</li>
				<li>CASE STUDIES, design real-life situations and problem based learning</li>
				<li>CMS, Edit portal homepage and news and rely on templates to build information easily</li>
				<li>DIGITAL LIBRARY, A full-text visual search that generates thumbnails of resources</li>
				<li>DOCUMENT TEMPLATES, Ease productivity with 30 content templates based on visual metaphors for the explanation</li>
				<li>DRAG&amp; DROP MATCHING, Experience touchscreen quizzes for an intuitive gathering of information</li>
				<li>ERGONOMICS, interface simplified</li>
				<li>GLOSSARY, Now visual, ergonomic and displays definitions in content : Documents, Quizzes, Wiki</li>
				<li>GRAPHICAL DESIGN, new design with Oxygen Icons and a display imagined by Fran√ßoise Desmartin</li>
				<li>GRADEBOOK, Generate reports on a&nbsp; blended learning scenario including face-to-face exams and presence sheets</li>
				<li>FIX WIDTH INTERFACE, designed for a 1024 pixels screen, improved ergonomics</li>
				<li>MEDIABOX, a simple-to-use interface to exchange data and media with your mobile</li>
				<li>MINDMAPS, Create diagrams, import them into Dokeos and use them as a navigation support, an explanation tool</li>
				<li>MOBILE COMPLIANCE, Dokeos 2.0 works in iPads, Android smartphones, most mobile devices</li>
				<li>NOTEBOOK, Students can save information when attending a face-to-face course</li>
				<li>QUIZBUILDER, rely on templates to create sophisticated quizzes rapidly and efficiently</li>
				<li>REPORTING, Now graphical with a synthetic view on progress, groups, time etc.</li>
				<li>SCENARIO, structure course material along a pedagogical strategy</li>
				<li>SERIOUS GAME, Import serious games and play them online with reporting</li>
				<li>SECURITY, Configure passwords requirements like "change password at first login"</li>
				<li>SOCIAL NETWORK, allow students collaborate informally</li>
				<li>SURVEYS, Now easy to use with nice cross-reporting</li>
				<li>THIRD PART CONTENT, Improved display of courses built in other authoring tools. Dokeos is more transparent</li>

				<li>VIDEO INTEGRATION, Import Flash video, MPG</li>

	<h1>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 - August 2009</h1>
	<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
	<p>Dokeos
1.8.6.1 is a minor&nbsp;release including just a few new features,
mostly focused on internationalization, and several bugfixes.</p>
	<h3>New Features</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Implemented new sub-language feature by which language terms redefinition becomes possible through the admin section (FS#4321)</li>
	  <li>Admin: Terms and conditions added DT#4320</li>
	  <li>Improvements in document tool, allow seeing glossary terms (FS#4337)</li>
	  <li>Small improvements in SCORM export(FS#4300)</li>
	  <li>At the beginning of the installation script, added an imperative check for PHP 5 has been added. (FS#4296)</li>
	  <li>When
the system Dokeos is switched into "Test server" mode, a clickable
indicator appears in the footer. This indicator is visible by platform
administrators only. (FS#4341)</li>
	  <li>A transliteration function
has been added. Currently, it is used in uploading files. Files with
non-English names get names that contain ASCII letters only, remaining
readable in the corresponding language. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time
environment does not manage file name encodings, adding such a
non-native feature involves too much work. For avoiding character
encoding problems, transliteration of file names is the possible
solution. (FS#306)</li>
	  <li>An internationalization option has been added for improving sorting in arbitrary language. When the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php" target="_blank">intl</a>
php-extension has been installed, various sorting routines exploit it
for better sorting. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not
provide native and reliable way of sorting UTF-8 strings. (FS#306)</li>
	  <li>Installation
script: The page about system requilements has been updated. Also, at
the very beginning, a check has been added whether the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php" target="_blank">mbstring</a> php-extension is installed - see <a href="http://dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29548" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#306)</li>
	  <li>A new php-based configuration for the online editor has been implemented, see <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/myconfig.php</i>. Also, toolbar definitions have been split in separate php-files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . Customization of the editor is more convenient and flexible now. (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Online editor: A upgrade from FCKEditor 2.6.4 to <strong>FCKEditor 2.6.4.1</strong> has been implemented. (FS#4383)</li>
	  <li>Online
editor: Blocking copy/paste for trainees has been added. The feature is
configurable through editing the toolbar definition files within the
directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Online editor: Preview tabs have been added to the dialogs for inserting video, flv-video, and YouTube video. (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Online editor: The <strong>audio</strong>
plugin has been activated by default as an implementation of the
"Insert audio / Audio properties" dialog. This new plugin is intended
to replace the "MP3" plugin. (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Online editor: The
simple file manager, the advanced file manager and the image manager
have been integrated by default with the editor's dialog system. Thus,
they work faster and in a more secure way. (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Online editor: Configuration of the <strong>mimetex</strong> plugin has been reworked to gain simplicity. The procedure for configuration has been updated, see <a href="http://www.dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29594" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Online editor: A new <strong>asciimath</strong> plugin for inserting mathematical formulas has been added. It is based on the <a href="http://mathcs.chapman.edu/%7Ejipsen/mathml/asciimath.html" target="_blank">ASCIIMathML.js</a> library. (FS#2867)</li>
	  <li>Social:
Added possibility to define RSS feeds inside personal page of social
network (need to define an 'rssfeeds' extra user text field)</li>
	</ul>
