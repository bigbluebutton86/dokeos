/**
 * Learning Path
 * Container script for the messages coming from the learnpath object. Initially, this wasn't supposed to be
 * a separate file but rather some text included in lp_view.php, but SCORM involves loading a script that
 * saves the data asynchronously while the SCORM learning path carries on. Having an informational iframe
 * helps not popping up an additional window when saving data.
 *
 * This script is also used to refresh the TOC as sometimes the SCORM JS messages are taken into account
 * only after the TOC is drawn. As such, you might complete an item, browse to the next page, have the
 * TOC drawn with your 'incomplete' status, while the SCORM messages generally arrives just after the TOC
 * is drawn. By updating it here and in lp_save.php, we avoid funny visual effect like having a complete
 * item showing as incomplete.
