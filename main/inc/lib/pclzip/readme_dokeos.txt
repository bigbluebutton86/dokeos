Additional note from the Dokeos company
December, 2008
------------------------------------------------------


Within Dokeos LMS the PclZip 2.6 library has been integrated for providing
compression and extraction functions for Zip formatted archives.

Also, the file pclzip.lib.php has been upgraded to CVS revision 1.48
(http://phpzip.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/phpzip/pclzip/pclzip.lib.php?revision=1.48)
in order a known bug to be fixed. See http://www.dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14424 for
detailed information.

The file pclzip.lib_original.php is the original file from the distribution archive
of PclZip 2.6.

Branch: MAIN
CVS Tags: HEAD
Changes since 1.47: +35 -21 lines
Bug correction : When adding files with full windows path (drive letter)
PclZip is now working. Before, if the drive letter is not the default
path, PclZip was not able to add the file.



Additional changes: gzopen64() - 20090930
------------------------------
An additional change has been applied to check on the zlib extension by probing
gzopen64() as well as gzopen() in the PclZip() function. This is due to a
recent change in the Zlib library, whereby the gzopen() function has been
updated and moved to gzopen64().
This problem has been reported to PhpConcept (editors of PclZip).
