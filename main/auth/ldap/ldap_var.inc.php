*	LDAP settings
*	In the older code, there was a distinction between
*	the teacher and student LDAP server. Later I decided not
*	to make this distinction. However, it could be built in
*	in the future but then perhaps in a more general way.
*
*	Originally, Thomas and I agreed to store all settings in one file
*	(configuration.php) to make it easier for claroline admins to make changes.
*	Since October 2003, this changed: the include directory has been
*	changed to be called "inc", and all tools should have their own file(s).
*
*	This file "ldap_var.inc.php" was already used by the
*	older french authentification functions. I have moved the new
*	variables from the configuration.php to here as well.
